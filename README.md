# TeachMeSkills_C32_HW_Lesson_15
### Here the following tasks are implemented:
Task 1 - 
Create a collection of integers and fill it with values entered from the console.
When filling the collection with numbers from the console, type casting should be done.
You can use the following code for casting a string to a number:
int i = Integer.parseInt(str);
or int val = Integer.valueOf(str);
To finish entering, type "exit".
When converting a string to a number, consider the possibility of exceptions.
Useful code examples for string-to-number conversion can be found here:

Print even numbers from the collection to the screen.

Fill the collection with random numbers.
The collection size should be provided from the console.
Ensure that the entered size is valid.
Calculate and display the arithmetic mean of all the elements in the collection.
